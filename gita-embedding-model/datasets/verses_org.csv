The mind is the supervisor, the individual soul is the tenant, the five vital airs are the five laborers. The Primordial Nature is the mistress of the field, her property, she herself watches over the field vigilantly, she is endowed with the three alities. If the individual soul does evil actions, it sows the seeds of sin, manures with evil, reaps a crop of sin, and undergoes the pains of Samsara. If it does virtuous actions, it sows the good seeds of virtue and reaps a crop of happiness."""

",Hindi Translation By Swami Ramsukhdas,"Here is the translation of the given sentence entirely into English:

""Many sages (such as Vasishtha) have spoken about it (the true nature of the field and its knower) since ancient times. The ancient hymns (such as the Rig Veda) have explained this in various ways. The Brahma Sutras refer to the Vedanta Sutras written by Vyasa or Badarayanacharya to reconcile mutually contradictory passages in the Upanishads. A study of the Brahma Sutras is necessary to comprehend the esoteric significance of the Upanishads. The Braham Sutras are also known as the Sariraka Sutras because fifteen sutras in the third pada of the second chapter deal with the body (Sarira or Kshetra). The true nature of the field and its knower has also been taught in the Brahma Sutras, which deal with Brahman, such as 'Only as the Self, let a man meditate on It' (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad I.4.7). They are full of reasoning, convincing, and decisive. There is no doubt in the words or passages that treat of Brahman."""

Mind is at the root of all activities. It gives strength to desires? fosters fear and builds castles in the air. It confers force on egoism and stimulates, aspirations. Every tendency has its origin in the mind. It augments passions? gives strength to hope and awakens the sense of duality. It increases ignorance and plunges the senses in the ocean of sense objects. It creates distinctions and differences. It separates? divides and limits. It is a strong wall or an iron barrier that stands between the individual soul and the Absolute. It is this mind that has brought Brahman to the condition of the individual soul. It is the storehouse of error? cravings? doubt? delusion and ignorance.

13.7 desires? hatred? pleasure? pain? aggregate? intelligence? firmness? These are mental states and properties of the body according to the Sankhya school of thought. Desire is a modification of the mind, born of Rajas, which urges a person to enjoy an object again once they have experienced its pleasure. Hatred is a negative modification that arises when a person experiences pain from an object. Pleasure and pain are both knowable fields. The aggregate or combination of the body and senses is also a field. Intelligence is a mental state that manifests itself in the aggregate, much like fire manifests itself in iron. Firmness or courage is a Sattvic modification of the mind that helps sustain the body and senses when they are depressed or agitated. The five elements in the body fight amongst themselves, but they cooperate harmoniously to carry out the body's functions. Desire, hatred, pleasure, pain, aggregate, intelligence, and firmness are all knowable fields."

""Nonattachment (Asakti) means the absence of liking for objects. False identification (Anabhishvangah) refers to intense attachment to someone or something, including one's spouse, children, or other close relatives. The wise have no attachment to their homes, considering them as public inns on the side of a public road. Evenmindedness (Nityam) or equanimity is an index of knowledge, as the man of wisdom is neither elated when he gets desirable objects nor grieves when he attains undesirable objects. Nonattachment, absence of affection, and evenmindedness are all conducive to the attainment of knowledge of the Self."""

In English:
The liberated sage has constant awareness of the Self. He knows that knowledge of the Self alone is permanent and all other learning relating to this world is ignorance. He knows that the knowledge which leads to the realization of the Self is the only truth. These attributes, starting with humility, are declared to be knowledge because they are conducive to knowledge and are the means to knowledge. The fruit of this knowledge of the Self is deliverance from the cycle of births and deaths. The spiritual aspirant should always keep the end of knowledge in view. Only then will he attempt to develop the various virtues that are conducive to the attainment of knowledge of the Self. What is opposed to knowledge? Such as lust, anger, greed, pride, hypocrisy, attachment, cunningness, injuring others? Ignorance. These evil traits, which are the products of ignorance, bind a person to samsara. If you wish to attain knowledge of the Self, you will have to eradicate these evil traits, which stand as stumbling blocks on the path of salvation. If you cultivate the opposite virtues, the evil traits will die by themselves, just as plants deprived of water in a garden die by themselves. It is difficult to eradicate the evil traits by fighting against them."

""What has to be known? Which one? That (Brahman) I will declare. Knowledge of which? The unchanging, immortal Brahman. Attains to what? The beginningless, supreme Brahman. Not this (nonbeing), not that (being).""

In this passage, the author is discussing the nature of Brahman, the ultimate reality and absolute truth. The author is emphasizing that Brahman cannot be defined or described using ordinary language or concepts, as it transcends all limitations and categories.

Brahman sees without eyes, hears without ears, smells without nose, eats without mouth, feels without skin, grasps without hands, walks without feet. He is the unseen seer, the unheard hearer, the unthought thinker. Other than Him, there is no seer, no hearer, no thinker. He is the Self, the Inner Ruler, the Immortal.

All the senses, including the five organs of knowledge and the five organs of action, as well as the inner senses, mind, and intellect, come under the term ""all the senses."" The organs of action and those of knowledge perform their functions in conjunction with the mind and intellect. Brahman is transcendental and unmanifest, but It manifests itself through the limiting adjuncts of the external and internal senses. Despite being without the senses, Brahman is unattached and yet supports all. It is the support or substratum of everything, and is devoid of the alities of Nature yet enjoys those alities. Brahman is truly mysterious."

Brahman is subtle like the ether. It is incomprehensible to the unillumined due to its extreme subtlety. It is unknowable to one who is not endowed with the four means of salvation. Brahman is known or realized by the wise. It is realized by the first-class aspirant who is equipped with these means. It is near to the wise man or the illumined, as it is their very Self. It is very far from the ignorant man who is drowned in worldliness or sensual pleasures. It is not attainable by the ignorant or unenlightened even in millions of years.

The ten organs? mind and the five objects of the senses are the sixteen modifications or effects. Mahat (intellect) is born of Mulaprakriti. From Mahat Ahamkara (egoism) is born. Mahat is the effect of Mulaprakriti and the cause of Ahamkara. Therefore Mahat is called PrakritiVikriti. Mahat? Ahamkara and the five Tanmatras (root elements of matter) are the seven PrakritiVikriti. Each of these is a modification of its predecessor and is in turn the cause of its successor. The five root elements generate the five gross elements. They are the subtle elements.

Sad-Sadhyatmika jivatman, i.e., the soul identifying itself with the body and the senses, which are modifications of Nature, acts through the alities of Nature and experiences pleasure and pain and delusion. It thinks ""I am happy""? ""I am miserable""? ""I am deluded""? ""I am wise""? When it thus identifies itself with the alities, it assumes individuality and takes birth in pure and impure wombs. The soul enjoys the sensual objects in conjunction with the body, mind, and senses and thus becomes the enjoyer. Brahman is the silent witness and non-enjoyer. Attachment to the alities of pleasure, pain, and delusion is the chief cause of its birth. If you add the word Samsara to the second half of the verse, it will mean attachment to the alities is the cause of Samsara through births in good and evil wombs. Good wombs are those of the gods and the like; evil wombs are those of lower animals. The human womb is partly good and partly evil on account of mixed Karmas."

It is entirely distinct from them. It is a silent witness of their activities. It sits near Nature and silently watches Her actions.

Such is the advantage he gains from the discriminative knowledge of Spirit and Matter. He knows that he is eternal and unchanging, and that all changes are due to the modifications of Nature due to its attributes. The self, through ignorance, identifies itself with the body and suffers rebirth. In whatever condition he may be? whether engaged in prescribed or forbidden actions (like Indra who killed the priest Visvarupa and many sannyasins)? he is not born again? because the actions of one who knows the Spirit and Matter? who has gained knowledge of the Self? are burnt by the fire of that knowledge. Just as the seeds that are fried in fire do not sprout again? so also the actions burnt in the fire of knowledge cannot produce new bodies or further births. Even though the Prarabdha Karma, which has given rise to this present body, continues to act until its inherent force is fully exhausted? although the sage has attained Self-realization through his body? he is not affected by it at all? because he has no identification with the body and has identified himself with Brahman or the Absolute. The arrow that is placed ready on the bow but not discharged with force can be withdrawn. Similarly, the Karma that has not begun to generate its effects can be neutralized or destroyed by the knowledge of the Self. Therefore, it is proper to say that the liberated sage is not born again."""

Commentary: Ahimsa is non-injury to living beings in thought, word, and deed. Samata is a state where there is neither liking nor disliking, when one gets pleasant or unpleasant objects. Tushti is contentment or satisfaction. A man of contentment is satisfied with whatever he gets through his Prarabdha, and is free from greed. Austerity is restraint of the senses through bodily mortification. Beneficence is sharing one's own things with others according to one's means, especially to a worthy person in a fit place and time. Fame is due to Dharma or virtuous actions, while ill-fame is due to Adharma or sinful actions. All these different kinds of attributes of living beings arise from the great Lord of the worlds according to their respective Karmas."

9.2 The king of sciences? kingly secret? purifier? this? highest? realisable by direct intuitional knowledge? according to righteousness? very easy? to perform? imperishable.

Commentary: Lord Krishna eulogizes the knowledge of Brahman highly to create interest in spiritual aspirants for attaining it quickly. There is neither blind faith nor faithmongering in this royal science. The truth, the sovereign, can be directly realized by intuition or immediate perception. The science of the Absolute is the most magnificent of all sciences and the supreme purifier, destroying the roots of all karmas and karmic effects stored over many births in a twinkle of an eye. It destroys avidya along with its effects, but even if removed, the effect of that sin remains subtly in the mind, forcing one to commit sinful acts in the next birth. However, the knowledge of the Self destroys all sins in their gross and subtle states accumulated over many births, including avidya, their cause. This is why it is a supreme purifier. The causal body of the jiva is called mula avidya (root ignorance), while avidya or the veil of ignorance enveloping visible objects in this world is called sthula avidya or gross ignorance. The knowledge of the Self is not opposed to dharma, and it is the fruit of all actions done in many births without expecting fruits. Additionally, this knowledge is easily attainable, and one must strive hard every moment as life is uncertain, and the prize (final liberation) is great."

They do atrocious crimes and cruel actions. They rob others' property and murder people. They partake of the nature of the demons and the undivine beings.

They have no knowledge of the Self that dwells within the body. They do not behold God in the universe. They live for eating and drinking only. He who entertains hope of getting the rewards of actions through mere Karma alone? without the grace of the Lord is one of empty hope and empty deed. Karmas are insentient. They cannot give rewards independently. The omniscient Lord Who knows the relationship between Karmas and their fruits can dispense them.

Even if the most sinful person worships Him with an undivided heart, they too must be deemed righteous for they have made a holy resolution to give up their evil ways. As seen in the example of Rogue Ratnakar, who became Valmiki through his holy resolve, and Jagai and Madhai, who became righteous devotees. Mary Magdalene, a woman of ill repute, became a pious woman. Sin disappears when thoughts of God arise in the mind. Chandrayana and Kricchra Vratas can remove certain particular sins, but the remembrance of the Lord, thoughts of the Supreme Being, Japa (repetition of holy names), meditation, and Abheda Brahma Chintana (contemplation of Brahman with a non-dualistic or Aham Brahmasmi or I am the Absolute attitude) will destroy sins committed by a person even in hundreds of millions of Kalpas or ages. By abandoning evil ways in his external life and through the force of his internal right resolution, he becomes righteous and attains eternal peace."

Chandalas or outcastes are of a sinful birth, women and Sudras are forbidden by social norms from studying the Vedas. What is desired is devotion, there is no need for family traditions. The elephant Gajendra remembered Me with devotion and attained Me despite being an animal. The lowest of the low and the vilest of the vile can attain Me if they have faith and devotion, if they chant and repeat My Name, and if they always think of Me without any worldly object.

Prahlada was a demon but through his devotion, I incarnated as Narasimha. Birth is immaterial, devotion is everything. The Gopis attained Me through their devotion. Kamsa and Ravana attained Me through fear. Sisupala reached Me through hatred. Narada, Dhruva, Akrura, Suka, Sanatkumara, and others attained Me through their devotion. Nandan, a man of low caste but a great devotee of Lord Siva, had direct vision of the Lord in Chidambaram, South India. Raidas, a cobbler, was a great devotee. In the spiritual life or in the Adhyatmic sphere, all external distinctions of caste, color, and creed disappear altogether. Shabari, though a Bhilni by birth, was a great devotee of Lord Rama.

Hindu scriptures are full of such instances, Hinduism does not restrict salvation to any one group or section of humanity; all can attain God if they have devotion."

The translation of the sentence in English is:

""Are not the other three kinds of devotees dear to the Lord? They are all noble souls. But the wise man is exceedingly dear because he has a steady mind, fixed on Brahman. He does not want any worldly object; he seeks the Supreme Being alone as the supreme goal. He practices Ahamgraha Upasana (meditation on the Self as the all) and tries to realize that he is identical with the Supreme Self. Therefore, I regard a wise man as My very Self."""

The power of discrimination is lost in those who are victims of desire and aversion.

He who has renounced austerities and other meritorious acts like building resthouses? charitable dispensaries? digging wells? feeding the poor? etc. Sannyasi he who has renounced the fruits of his actions. Yogi he who has a steady mind. These two terms are applied to him in a secondary sense only. They are not used to denote that he is in reality a Sannyasi and a Yogi. The Sannyasi performs neither Agnihotra nor other ceremonies. But simply to omit these without genuine renunciation will not make one a real Sannyasi. (Cf. V.3)"

Action purifies the mind and makes it fit for steady meditation, leading to concentration and meditation. For a sage enthroned in Yoga, renunciation of actions is the means. The more perfectly he abstains from actions, the steadier his mind is and the more peaceful he is, making it easier and more thorough for his mind to fixate in the Self. For a Brahmana, knowledge of oneness and homogeneity (of the Self in all beings), truthfulness, good character, steadiness, harmlessness, and renunciation of all actions are wealth."

The mind is one-pointed through the practice of Yoga, where the mind is collected and focused on a single point or centre, gradually leading to concentration and one-pointedness. This is achieved through regular meditation and introspection, where the individual observes their own thoughts and emotions, and through this self-awareness, they can control their mind and senses. By practising Yoga, the individual can purify their self, which refers to both the mind and the highest Self, or Brahman. The key to success is regularity and consistency in one's practice, as well as a deep understanding of the workings of the mind and its tendencies."

No, it is not. Even? च and? अर्जुन O Arjuna.

The Lord prescribes moderation in eating and sleeping. If one eats too much, they will feel drowsy and sleep will overpower them, leading to indigestion, flatulence, diseases of the bowels and liver. Eating too little will result in weakness, making it difficult to sit for meditation. The prescribed diet is half the stomach should be filled with food, and the remaining fourth should be empty for free movement of air. This is the Mitahara or moderate diet for a Yoga student. Sleeping too much will make one lethargic, causing dullness in the mind and heaviness in the body, making meditation impossible. Sleeping too little will lead to drowsiness, causing one to sleep during meditation. It is important to maintain a golden medium for rapid progress in Yoga."

The mind is constantly changing its focus and is therefore restless. Krishna is derived from Krish, meaning to scrape, as He scrapes away sins and evil tendencies from the hearts of His devotees. The mind is not only restless but also turbulent or impetuous, strong and obstinate. It causes agitation in the body and senses. The mind is drawn to various objects through the five senses, making it difficult to control. It enjoys sensual pleasures with the help of these senses and the body, making it susceptible to external influences.

Here is the translation of the entire sentence:

The mind is restless (चलम्) and difficult to control (असंशयम्), but through practice (अभ्यासेन) and dispassion (वैराग्येण), it can be made steady and one-pointed. The constant repetition of the same idea or thought of the Self or God destroys the vacillation of the mind and desires, making it steady and focused. This is achieved through constantly looking into the evil in sense objects (DoshaDrishti). Ultimately, the mind must be trained to seek its enjoyment not in perishable external objects but in the immortal and changeless Self within."

The Upadhis or the limiting adjuncts such as the physical body? the mind? the intellect? etc.? which are superimposed on Brahman through ignorance are sublated and the identity of the individual soul with the Supreme Soul or Brahman is realised. To sacrifice the self in Brahman is to know through direct cognition (Aparoksha Anubhuti) that the individual soul is identical with Brahman. This is the highest Yajna. Those who are established in Brahman? those who have realised their oneness with the Supreme Soul or Paramatma perform this kind of sacrifice. This is superior to all other sacrifices."

The fire of knowledge destroys all actions, except for the Prarabdha Karma (the result of past actions that has already begun to bear fruit). According to some philosophers, even the Prarabdha Karma is destroyed by the fire of knowledge.

""Unwise people who lack discrimination place great emphasis on the ritualistic portion of the Vedas, known as the Karma Kanda, which lays down specific rules for specific actions leading to specific fruits. They are enamored of Vedic passages that describe ways to attain heavenly enjoyments. They believe that there is nothing beyond sensual enjoyments in Svarga (heaven) that can be obtained through performing the rites of the Karma Kanda of the Vedas. There are two main sections of the Vedas: Karma Kanda and Jnana Kanda. The Karma Kanda consists of the Brahmanas and Samhitas, which is the authority for the Purvamimamsa school founded by Jaimini. Followers of this school prescribe rituals for attaining enjoyments and power here and happiness in heaven. They consider this as the ultimate goal of human existence. Ordinary people are attracted to their praises. The Jnana Kanda consists of the Aranyakas and Upanishads, which deal with the nature of Brahman or the Supreme Self. Life in heaven is transitory, and after the fruits of good actions are exhausted, one must come back to the earthplane. Liberation or Moksha can only be attained through knowledge of the Self, not through performing a thousand and one sacrifices. Lord Krishna assigns an inferior position to the doctrine of the Mimamsakas, who perform Vedic sacrifices for obtaining heavenly power and lordship in this world, as they cannot lead to final liberation."""

18.17 Whose? Not? Egoistic? The notion? Intelligence? Of whom? Not? Tainted? Having slain? Even? He? These? People? Not? Slays? Bound.

Commentary: The verse explains the characteristics of a person who has transcended activity and egoism. They are not bound by actions, as they have renounced desire and personal gain. They know that the Self is not destroyed when the body perishes, and they have no idea of agency. The act of killing is necessary for the peace and harmony of the world, and their killing is like the killing of a murderer by an executioner and judge on behalf of the community. A person who has a trained intellect, pure understanding, and developed reason, who has devoted themselves to studying scriptures, and who is eipped with knowledge of logic, is absolutely free from egoistic notions and knows that Nature or Guna or one's own nature does everything. They think they are the silent witness of all activities, and they are not the doer. The five senses, body, actor, etc., which are superimposed on the pure Self through ignorance, are the causes of all actions. They are not affected by actions, as they have no hands, legs, feet, breath, or mind. They are ever pure, spotless, and immovable, and they cannot do a wrong action. Their will has become one with the cosmic will, and their will has become blended with the Lord's will. Whatever they do is done by the Lord only. They see rightly, and though they kill, they are not bound by the fruit of a vicious action as an effect of that act. They are beyond good and evil, beyond pairs of opposites, as they have knowledge of the Self. An objector may say that the statement ""though he kills, he does not commit the act of killing"" is self-contradictory. The verse explains that from the transcendental point of view, the Lord says ""he kills not,"" because man identifies the Self with the body, etc., and thinks the killer is the Self. From the worldly point of view, the Lord says ""he kills,"" because the Self acts in conjunction with the body, etc. Another objector may say that the Self acts in conjunction with the body, etc., and therefore cannot be unaffected. However, the verse explains that the Self is indivisible, all-pervading, infinite, limbless, without parts, independent, ever free, and immutable, and therefore the actions of the body can never be ascribed to the agency of the Self. The wise man who is free from egoism and all impurities of the mind neither kills nor is he bound though he kills."

The Sudras have no claim to the Vedic rites because their profession is to serve the members of the first three castes. There is an organization of humanity into four castes, and each person's life is divided into four stages based on their natural tendencies. By means of these Gunas, individuals can free themselves from the cycle of birth and death and attain Self-realization or knowledge of the Self. Passion (Rajas) mixed with Tamas causes the growth of the merchant caste (Vaisya). Rajas mixed with Tamas is the cause of the appearance of the Sudra. The one human race has been divided into four castes based on the three Gunas, and duties are assigned to each according to their natural tendencies."""

Commentary:
The Apastamba Dharma Sutra declares that men of various castes and orders each devoted to his respective duties reap the fruits of their actions after death and then by the residual Karma attain to births in superior Dharma, span of life, learning, conduct, wealth, happiness and intelligence (2?2?2?3). There is a vivid description in the Puranas also of the different results and worlds which men of the four castes and orders obtain by discharging their respective duties."

The lower self should be controlled with firmness by the Self of pure intellect. The turbulent senses and mind should be subdued with the help of pure intellect or reason. Pure reason is a great power. Whenever senses raise their heads and hiss, they should be hammered by the powerful rod of pure intellect or reason. Reason is the faculty of determination.
Pure intellect is like a clear mirror. A pure intellect is Brahman itself. It can be easily merged in Brahman. When pure intellect merges in Brahman, the reflected intelligence, Chidabhasa or Jiva, is also absorbed in Brahman. The Jiva becomes identical with Brahman, just as ether in the pot becomes one with universal ether when pot is broken.
The self is the aggregate of body and senses.
Through repeated practice of Pratyahara (abstraction) and Dama (self-restraint), the aspirant withdraws senses from their respective objects again and again. Gradually, senses are fixed in the Self. Their outgoing tendencies are totally curbed. The aspirant attains supreme control of senses through constant meditation, by practicing dispassion, he conquers Raga (attachment), and through practice of pure love or cosmic love or divine Prem, he conquers hatred. He abandons all luxuries and keeps only those objects necessary for bare maintenance of body. He has neither attachment nor hatred even for those objects."

1. ये - Who? (The word ""ye"" is not used in English, so I will simply translate it as ""who"".)
2. शास्त्रविधिम् - The ordinances of the scriptures? (This phrase can be translated as ""the teachings of the scriptures"".)
3. उत्सृज्य - Setting aside? (This word can be translated as ""abandoning"" or ""giving up"".)
4. यजन्ते - Perform sacrifice? (The word ""yajante"" is not used in English, so I will translate it as ""perform sacrifices"".)
5. श्रद्धया - With faith? (This phrase can be translated as ""with devotion"".)
6. अन्विताः - Endowed? (The word ""anvitah"" is not used in English, so I will translate it as ""endowed"".)
7. तेषाम् - Their? (This word can be translated as ""their"".)
8. निष्ठा - Condition? (This word can be translated as ""state"".)

15. तमः - Tamas. (This word can be translated as ""Tamas"".)

Now, let me provide the translation of the entire sentence:

""Who are the people who are endowed with faith? They follow a path in accordance with their inherent nature -- either Sattvic, Rajasic or Tamasic. Arjuna says to Krishna that it is very difficult to grasp the meaning of the scriptures, and it is even more difficult to get a spiritual preceptor who can teach them. The vast majority of persons are not endowed with a pure, subtle, sharp, and one-pointed intellect. The span of life is short, and the scriptures are endless. The obstacles on the spiritual path are many, and facilities for learning are not always available. There are conflicting statements in the scriptures that have to be reconciled. Krishna says that liberation is not possible without a knowledge of the scriptures. An ordinary man, though ignorant of or unable to follow this teaching, does charity, performs rituals, worships the Lord with faith, tries to follow the footsteps of sages and saints just as a child copies letters that have been written out for him as a model, or as a blind man makes his way by the aid of another who possesses sight. What faith is his? How should the state of such a man be described -- Sattvic, Rajasic, or Tamasic?"""

","He who considers It (the self) to be the slayer, and he who thinks of It as slain—both are ignorant. For, the self neither slays nor is being slain.","The sentence in English is:

""Faith assumes a threefold aspect under the influence of the three alities. When Sattva is strongly developed, it is easy for him to attain Self-realization or knowledge of the Self. If Rajas is predominant, faith becomes the handmaid of activity. If Tamas or inertia prevails, faith is annihilated. Those who are endowed with Sattvic faith aim at the attainment of liberation. Those who are endowed with Rajasic faith run after inferior duties or worldly activities. Those whose faith is Tamasic are cruel. They kill animals for sacrifice. They invoke the spirits and talk with ghosts.""

The sentence is a commentary on the threefold nature of faith, which is influenced by the three alities or gunas of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. The commentary discusses how faith can manifest differently depending on the predominant quality of an individual's mind, and how it can lead to different outcomes such as liberation or worldly activities."

""At a wrong place and time, giving alms or other charity to the poor and needy is not restricted. However, if done without respect, pleasant speech, washing of feet, or worship, it does not count as true generosity, even if made at an appropriate time and place. The donor must give in good faith and treat the recipient with dignity, offering them a seat and showing them respect. Krishna explains to Arjuna that the qualities of faith, charity, and austerity are affected by the three attributes of passion, ignorance, and darkness. By setting aside these lower qualities, the third, or purest quality, becomes more clearly visible and attainable. Therefore, to illustrate the true nature of purity, Krishna describes the other two qualities."""

 ","Om Tat Sat is the root of the universe.
Om represents the unchanging, indefinable Brahman.
Tat means the Supreme Being, the abode of all living things.
Sat signifies reality.
Para Brahman refers to the supreme being beyond names and classes.
The Vedas have given a name to Him, but a newborn baby has no name and will answer according to its nature.
Men seek refuge in the deity by calling Him by His given name, revealing what is hidden within themselves.
These three words have divine power, arousing the latent divinity within and securing a response from the cosmic being they represent.
When a sacrifice or spiritual discipline is found defective, it can be perfected through the utterance of Om Tat Sat or one of the three designations.
With the repetition of Om or Om Tat Sat, all acts of sacrifice, study of sacred scriptures, and meditation are initiated.
Om Tat Sat has been declared to be the triple designation of Brahman in Vedanta by those who know Brahman.
The power of creation emanates from this mantra, and when repeated, the creator achieved the power to create.
Then he created the Brahmanas, gave them the Vedas as a guide, and directed them to perform sacrifices and other rites."

Ahimsa: Noninjury in thought, word, and deed. By refraining from injuring living creatures, the outgoing forces of Rajas are curbed. Ahimsa is divided into physical, verbal, and mental.

Satyam: Truthfulness - speaking of things as they are, without uttering unpleasant words or lies. This includes self-restraint, absence of jealousy, forgiveness, patience, endurance, and kindness.

Akrodhah: Absence of anger when insulted, ridiculed, or beaten - even under the gravest provocation.

Tyagah: Renunciation - literally, giving up one's egoism and the fruits of action. Charity is also Tyaga. This has already been mentioned in the previous verse.

Santih: Serenity of mind.

Apaisunam: Absence of narrow-mindedness.

Daya: Compassion towards those who are in distress. A compassionate person has a tender heart, and he lives only for the benefit of the world. Compassion indicates realization of unity or oneness with other creatures.

Aloluptvam: Noncovetousness - the senses are not affected or excited when they come in contact with their respective objects; the senses are withdrawn from the objects of the senses, just as the limbs of the tortoise are withdrawn into its own shell.

Hrih: Shame felt in performing actions contrary to the rules of the Vedas or society.

Achapalam: Not to speak or move the hands and legs in vain avoidance of useless action.

As Arjuna was already grief-stricken and dejected, Lord Krishna assured him not to feel alarmed at this description of the Asuric qualities that bring grief and delusion, for he was born with Sattvic tendencies leading towards salvation. Arjuna, upon hearing the words of Lord Krishna, may have thought to himself, 'Do I possess divine nature or demonic nature? The Lord said, 'Grieve not, O Arjuna, thou art born with divine qualities. Thou art fortunate, and thou mayest attain to the happiness of Self-realization.' Do not think that by engaging yourself in battle and killing people, you will become an Asura.

16.18 Egoism? Power? Haughtiness? Lust? Anger? Pride? Hypocrisy? These Asuras (demons) are self-sufficient and puffed up with mental and material power, posing too much, resenting it much if belittled, living solely for their bodies, using brutal force to gain selfish ends, abusing and ill-treating those who are truthful and charitable towards Me.

Egoism is the self-arrogating principle, the effect or modification of ignorance, the source of all defects and perversities in human nature and evil actions. Lust, anger, greed, pride, and hypocrisy are all attendants of egoism. It is difficult to overcome this dire enemy, but through vichara (right enquiry), it can be annihilated.

The Asuras have deep ignorance, esteeming themselves highly for their attributes and those they falsely superimpose upon themselves. They use their financial supremacy to humiliate and destroy others, bribing people to give false evidence and misusing their powers to attain selfish ends.

Power, accompanied by lust and attachment, is used to humiliate and destroy others. If a person does not have purity of heart, mind surcharged with evil tendencies, or practices concentration of mind without establishing themselves in Yama (the fivefold canon of ethical perfection consisting of non-injury, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy, and non-covetousness), they will misuse or abuse their powers and try to humiliate or abuse others.

Haughtiness is a man whose heart is filled with haughtiness, becoming insolent and unjust, assuming an overbearing and domineering attitude towards others, never respecting elders or Gurus. This is a peculiar vice that has its seat in the mind, causing one to swerve from the path of virtue when it manifests itself.

Anger manifests itself when one gets something unpleasant or comes across something disagreeable.

The Asuras hate Me, the Lord who dwells in their own bodies as the silent witness of their thoughts and actions, thinking that I am also a human being and hate Me. They do not understand My all-pervading and imperishable nature, and they do not care at all to know and follow My injunctions given in the Vedas and the Smritis. If anyone violates My injunctions, it is surely tantamount to an act of hatred towards Me. These people are very malicious and have evil intentions or impure motives. They are jealous of those persons who are virtuous and tread the path of righteousness, their hearts burning when they notice good attributes in others, which is Matsarya, a form of jealousy. If a man superimposes evil attributes on a virtuous man who is endowed with good attributes, this is Asuya. If his heart burns when he sees a wealthy or prosperous man, this is Irshya."

The countless objects, big and small, that life requires are all produced by the five elements through the action of the alities. This tree of Samsara is nourished by the three Nature-ally traits. The sense objects are its buds, and the roots that grow downward are the bonds of karma for those who lead a life of passion and attachment in this world, who are under the influence of likes and dislikes. The sprouts of this magnificent tree are the attractive sensory objects with their characteristics of sound, touch, color, taste, and smell. The roots—the karmic tendencies from past lives—grow downward to generate the bonds of karma in the world of men, strengthening them further through action.

The primal root is ignorance, from which emerges the eightfold Nature—the five elements, mind, intellect, and egoism. From the stem of the tree spring four branches called Svedaja, Andaja, Jarayuja, and Udbhijja. Eighty-four lakhs (eight million and four hundred thousand) of species have evolved. One branch shoots straight upward, yielding the fruit of enjoyment in heaven. Another branch is the branch of dispassion, yielding the fruit of Self-realization. The sun, planets, manes, and sages have also emerged from this wonderful tree. Above them are the branches of the worlds of Indra and the gods. Still higher are those of the sages and the men of austerities and penance. Still higher is the Satyaloka where Hiranyagarbha dwells.

Whatever regions are attained in accordance with one's nature of knowledge or action are the branching paths of the tree of Samsara. They are nourished and fattened by the three Gunas, which form their material basis. The sense objects—such as sound, touch, color, taste, and smell—represent the buds that sprout from the physical bodies, which are the products of actions.

The highest root of this magnificent tree is Brahman. The secondary roots are the latent impressions (Samskaras) of likes and dislikes, which spread in this world of men and impel them to perform virtuous and vicious actions and bind them fast to actions.

Now listen to the way by which this tree can be cut off. Only he who thus cuts his bondage to this tree of Samsara can be happy even in this world. He has the highest wisdom, for he stands as a spectator of this tree and knows it as it is, without being tied to it."

I am seated in the hearts of all sentient beings as their innermost Self. From Me, the Self of all beings, are memory, knowledge and their loss. Righteous persons have knowledge and memory as a result of virtuous deeds. Sinful persons have loss of memory and knowledge as a result of vicious deeds. Virtue promotes peace and hence intellectual powers. Loss (destruction or absence) of memory and knowledge is due to lust, anger, grief and delusion. I am the central topic of the Vedas. To understand the Vedas is to Know Me. I, the Supreme Being, am to be known in all the Vedas. It is I Who know the Vedic teaching or the meaning of the Vedas. I cause the teaching of the Vedanta to be handed down in regular succession. I am the author of what is beyond the Vedas, namely the Upanishads that constitute the Vedanta, which deal with the transcendental Supreme Being beyond all names and forms and devoid of all attributes.

From the next verse, a description of the form of Purushottama, Who is free from any limiting adjunct, will be given."

Just as winter has its sway when summer and autumn have gone, just as sleep has its sway when a man is neither dreaming nor waking, so also Sattva has its sway when Rajas and Tamas are suppressed and makes people say that they are happy. The Sadhana for increasing Sattva is given in the 17th and 18th chapters. Each ality acts in its own turn at different times. All the three alities cannot operate at one and the same time. When one ality asserts itself or dominates by overpowering or suppressing the other two, it produces its own effect. Sattva produces knowledge and happiness, Rajas action, Tamas veiling of knowledge, inertia, error, indolence, sloth, and sleep. When Sattva is in the ascendant in a man, he is endowed with discrimination. Sublime thoughts roll in his mind. He has pure understanding. His mind turns away from sensual pleasures and moves inward towards the Self.

The characteristic mark by which you can know that a particular ality is predominant or is in the ascendant is given in the following three verses:

1. When the mind is pure, and the intellect is unclouded, and the senses are under control, then Sattva is in the ascendant.
2. When one is free from the three faults of passion, ignorance, and madness, and has subdued the enemies within and without, then Sattva is predominant.
3. When the thoughts are deep, and the understanding is bright, and the mind is free from doubts and fears, then Sattva is in the ascendant."

Action is Sattvic, the fruit of good deeds is both happiness and knowledge. They say the wise.

Rajas means Rajasic action as this verse deals with action. The fruit of Rajasic action is bitter. Rajasic action brings pain, disappointment, and dissatisfaction. Rajasic activity leads to greed.
